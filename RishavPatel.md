## About Me
I am a UNCG third year student studying math and cs and I am planning on pursuing a masters in applied mathematics after graduating. I am from Charlotte, North Carolina. I was originally born in Bangalore, India but then moved to Houston, Texas in 2014 and finally Charlotte in 2017.

## My CSC340 Goals
Although I do not plan on becoming a software engineer, I hope to become a better programmer and understand what a software engineer is and what they do in order to work with them more efficiently in the future. Additionally software is everywhere and having a better understanding of how software is developed will prove to be very beneficial to me.
